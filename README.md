# Red-wine-quality-classification

## **CSC1000 Team Project 2020 CUHK-SZ**

Implementing Classification and Regression Tree (CART) without using libraries, except for NumPy and Pandas.

We have two datasets: train.csv for training data and test.csv for testing data.

To evaluate our model, we use accuracy metrics.

After implementing the model using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we evaluate it with the test data. The result is an accuracy of 87.29%.

We have uploaded the training file, testing file, and our Python code to GitHub.
